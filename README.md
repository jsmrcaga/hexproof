# Hexproof
Yet another Magic The Gathering Deckbuilder.

I built this deckbuilder app because I was not satisfied about the "discovery" other apps allow.
I love the [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com?ref=hexproof-github) search but the results page does not allow to "like" or "add" cards to a list.

Hexproof uses [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com?ref=hexproof-github) as an API, so you can use Scryfall grammar to search cards.

# App quirks

- To completely remove a card from a collection use metakey + click (on MacOS for example this would be `⌘ + click`).
- To Open a card in Gatherer from the search results you can Alt + click (`⌥ + click`)
- To Open a card in Scryfall from the search results you can meta + click (`⌘ + click`)
