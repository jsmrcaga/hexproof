# Hexproof
Yet another Magic The Gathering Deckbuilder.

I built this deckbuilder app because I was not satisfied about the "discovery" other apps allow.
I love the [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com?ref=hexproof-github) search but the results page does not allow to "like" or "add" cards to a list.

Hexproof uses [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com?ref=hexproof-github) as an API, so you can use Scryfall grammar to search cards.

# Usage
If you have 0 tech knowledge you can use this app at [hexproof.netlify.app](https://hexproof.netlify.app).

Otherwise you will need Node JS and that's it!
- Clone this repo
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the development server
